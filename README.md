## What's all this about? ðŸ¤”
React custom hooks allow us to abstract components logic into single reusable functions. The result of this architecture is a more readable, reusable, and durable way of writing React code.

Since I found myself copy and pasting a lot of the same logic throughout projects, I decided to pull that logic into one central location. This is my personal collection of (hopefully) useful React hooks that might also help other devs to speed up their development process.

## Install
